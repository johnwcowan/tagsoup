.B TagSoup
is a parser and reformatter for nasty, ugly HTML.
Its normal processing mode is to accept HTML files on the command line,
or from the standard input if none are given, and output them
as clean XML
to the standard output.  The encoding is assumed to be the platform-local
encoding on input, and is always UTF-8 on output.
.PP
When the
.B --files
option is given, each input file is processed into an output file of the
corresponding name, with the extension changed to
.IR xhtml .
If the extension is already
.IR xhtml ,
it is changed to
.IR xhtml_ .
.PP
TagSoup will repair, by whatever means necessary,
violations of XML well-formedness.  In particular, it will fix up
malformed attribute names and supply missing attribute-value quotation marks.
More significantly, it supplies end-tags where HTML allows them
to be omitted, and sometimes where it doesn't.  It will even supply
start-tags where necessary; for example, if a document begins with a
<li> tag, TagSoup will automatically prefix it with <html><body><ul>.
.PP
.SH BUGS
TagSoup can be fooled by missing close quotes after attribute values, and by
incorrect character encodings (it does not contain an encoding guesser).
.PP
Processing TagSoup output through TagSoup a second time should in principle
produce identical results, but sometimes does not.  That's why this release
is not 1.0.
.PP
TagSoup doesn't understand namespace declarations, which are not properly
part of HTML.  Instead, any element or attribute name beginning
.IR foo :
will be put into the artificial namespace
.RI urn:x-prefix: foo .
.PP
For the same reasons, namespace-qualified attributes like
xml:space
can't be returned as default values,
though an explicit attribute in the xml namespace
will be returned with the proper namespace URI.
