                        TagSoup - Just Keep On Truckin'

  Introduction

   This is the home page of TagSoup, a SAX-compliant parser written in
   Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as
   it is found in the wild: [1]nasty and brutish, though quite often far
   from short. TagSoup is designed for people who have to process this
   stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By
   providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied
   to even the worst HTML.

   TagSoup is free and Open Source software, licensed under the
   [2]Academic Free License, a cleaned-up and patent-safe BSD-style
   license which allows proprietary re-use. It's also licensed under the
   [3]GNU GPL, since unfortunately the GPL and the AFL are incompatible.
   You can choose to license TagSoup from me under either the GPL or the
   AFL. As of 1.0rc4, we are using the AFL version 3.0, which is upward
   compatible with 2.1.

  Warning: TagSoup will not build in Java 5.0!

   Due to a bug in Java 5.0's default XSLT implementation, TagSoup will
   not build out of the box on Java 5.0. Instead, build it under Java
   1.4, or else install Xalan or Saxon, and the result will then work
   fine under either 1.4 or 5.0.

  TagSoup 1.0 Release Candidate 4 released!!!

   Tagsoup 1.0rc4 is the fourth release candidate for TagSoup 1.0. Sorry
   for the long, long, long delay -- I think this release is really very
   close to the well-nigh mythical 1.0 release itself. Here are just some
   of the changes that have been accumulating:

   The parser removes a trailing '?' character from a processing
   instruction, in case the input is XHTML instead of HTML. This
   shouldn't affect Real World documents very much.

   The Javadoc has been improved, particularly for the SAX-standard and
   TagSoup-specific parser features and properties, all of which are now
   documented there.

   By popular demand, there is now a SAX parser feature and switch, the
   --nodefaults switch, to cause TagSoup not to return the default values
   that appear in the schema.

   The parser now supports SAX Locators, which specify the location in
   the input of any I/O exception thrown.

   Former releases had a hard-wired limit on attribute values and other
   single strings (element and attribute names, processing instructions,
   and so on) of 1980 characters. This limit has been removed.

   Handling of XML empty-tags has been corrected; previously they were
   returning the Wrong Thing to the application. As a side effect, SGML
   minimized end-tags like </> will also work -- they close the current
   element.

   The switches --method=html and --omit-xml-declaration are supported.
   The --html switch is equivalent to specifying both of these.

   The standard --help and --version switches have been added.

   When processing a start-tag, TagSoup does not restart elements that
   aren't in the new element's content model. This prevents pointless
   opens followed by immediate closes, and was the cause of many random
   extra tags being inserted in highly malformed documents.

   Note: If you go through and replace all references to HashMap with
   Hashtable in the source code and recompile under 1.4, TagSoup will
   work fine in Java 1.1 VMs. Thanks to Thorbjørn Vinne for this
   discovery.

   zip, you can use jar to unpack it.

  What TagSoup does

   TagSoup is designed as a parser, not a whole application; it isn't
   intended to permanently clean up bad HTML, as [6]HTML Tidy does, only
   to parse it on the fly. Therefore, it does not convert presentation
   HTML to CSS or anything similar. It does guarantee well-structured
   results: tags will wind up properly nested, default attributes will
   appear appropriately, and so on.

   The semantics of TagSoup are as far as practical those of actual HTML
   browsers. In particular, never, never will it throw any sort of syntax
   error: the TagSoup motto is [7]"Just Keep On Truckin'". But there's
   much, much more. For example, if the first tag is LI, it will supply
   the application with enclosing HTML, BODY, and UL tags. Why UL?
   Because that's what browsers assume in this situation. For the same
   reason, overlapping tags are correctly restarted whenever possible:
   text like:
This is <B>bold, <I>bold italic, </b>italic, </i>normal text

   gets correctly rewritten as:
This is <b>bold, <i>bold italic, </i></b><i>italic, </i>normal text.

   By intention, TagSoup is small and fast. Eventually, I will spend some
   time making it faster if it turns out to be too slow. It does not
   depend on the existence of any framework other than SAX, and should be
   able to work with any framework that can accept SAX parsers. In
   particular, [8]XOM is known to work.

   You can replace the low-level HTML scanner with one based on Sean
   McGrath's [9]PYX format (very close to James Clark's ESIS format). You
   can also supply an AutoDetector that peeks at the incoming byte stream
   and guesses a character encoding for it. (Otherwise, the platform
   default is used. If someone supplies a good AutoDetector I may package
   it with later releases -- the [10]Mozilla one is too big.

  The TSaxon XSLT-for-HTML processor

   [11]I am also distributing [12]TSaxon, a repackaging of version 6.5.3
   of Michael Kay's Saxon XSLT 1.0 implementation that includes TagSoup.
   TSaxon is a drop-in replacement for Saxon, and can be used to process
   either HTML or XML documents with XSLT stylesheets.

  TagSoup as a stand-alone program

   It is possible to run TagSoup as a program by saying java -jar
   tagsoup-1.0rc4 [option ...] [file ...]. Files mentioned on the command
   line will be parsed individually. If no files are specified, the
   standard input is read.

   The following options are understood:

   --files
          Output into individual files, with html extensions changed to
          xhtml. Otherwise, all output is sent to the standard output.

   --html
          Output is in clean HTML: the XML declaration is suppressed, as
          are end-tags for the known empty elements.

   --omit-xml-declaration
          The XML declaration is suppressed.

   --method=html
          End-tags for the known empty HTML elements are suppressed.

   --pyx
          Output is in PYX format.

   --pyxin
          Input is in PYXoid format (need not be well-formed).

   --nons
          Namespaces are suppressed. Normally, all elements are in the
          XHTML 1.x namespace, and all attributes are in no namespace.

   --nobogons
          Bogons (unknown elements) are suppressed. Normally, they are
          treated as empty.

   --any
          Bogons are given a content model of ANY rather than EMPTY.

   --lexical
          Pass through HTML comments. Has no effect when output is in PYX
          format.

   --reuse
          Reuse a single instance of TagSoup parser throughout. Normally,
          a new one is instantiated for each input file.

   --nocdata
          Change the content models of the script and style elements to
          treat them as ordinary #PCDATA (text-only) elements, as in
          XHTML, rather than with the special CDATA content model.

   --encoding=encoding
          Specify the input encoding. The default is the Java platform
          default.

   --help
          Print help.

   --version
          Print the version number.

  More information

   I gave a presentation (a nocturne, so it's not on the schedule) at
   [13]Extreme Markup Languages 2004 about TagSoup, updated from the one
   presented in 2002 at the New York City XML SIG and at XML 2002. This
   is the main high-level documentation about how TagSoup works. Formats:
   [14]OpenDocument [15]Powerpoint [16]PDF.

   I also had people add [17]"evil" HTML to a large poster so that I
   could [18]clean it up; View Source is probably more useful than
   ordinary browsing. The original instructions were:

                        SOUPE DE BALISES (BE EVIL)!
   Ecritez une balise ouvrante (sans attributs)
   ou fermante HTML ici, s.v.p.

   open to all.
