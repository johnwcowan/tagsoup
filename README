                        TagSoup - Just Keep On Truckin'

  Introduction

   This is the home page of TagSoup, a SAX-compliant parser written in
   Java that, instead of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as
   it is found in the wild: [1]nasty and brutish, though quite often far
   from short. TagSoup is designed for people who have to process this
   stuff using some semblance of a rational application design. By
   providing a SAX interface, it allows standard XML tools to be applied
   to even the worst HTML.

   TagSoup is free and Open Source software, licensed under the
   [2]Academic Free License, a cleaned-up and patent-safe BSD-style
   license which allows proprietary re-use. It's also licensed under the
   [3]GNU GPL, since unfortunately the GPL and the AFL are incompatible.

  TagSoup 1.0 Release Candidate 3 released!

   Tagsoup 1.0rc3 is the third release candidate for TagSoup 1.0. This is
   something of a misnomer, since I know there are still problems -- I
   have a new test suite with about 1000 randomly generated HTML
   documents, and about 8% of those show signs of trouble. However, in no
   case is the TagSoup output not well-formed XML. I'll continue to work
   on this problem, but I'm releasing 1.0rc3 now so that I can get
   various bug fixes out to users who need them.

   This release cleans up long-standing problems with detecting the
   end-tag for style and script elements. It should now require that the
   end-tag be exactly </style> or </script> as the case may be, but
   allows case-blind matching. Any other similar-looking string should
   not prematurely terminate the element.

   TagSoup now allows switches on the command line, though the Java
   properties are retained for backward compatibility. I may remove them
   later. I have modified this page to show switches only, and I have
   written a proper Unix man page, with a textual version for non-Unix
   users.

   The encoding=encoding switch is new and specifies the character
   encoding of the input files. The default is whatever is the Java
   default encoding on your platform.

   In addition, an element known to be empty will be closed immediately.
   Formerly, an empty element followed by a comment would, in --lexical
   mode, show up with the comment inside the element.

   zip, you can use jar to unpack it.

  What TagSoup does

   TagSoup is designed as a parser, not a whole application; it isn't
   intended to permanently clean up bad HTML, as [6]HTML Tidy does, only
   to parse it on the fly. Therefore, it does not convert presentation
   HTML to CSS or anything similar. It does guarantee well-structured
   results: tags will wind up properly nested, default attributes will
   appear appropriately, and so on.

   The semantics of TagSoup are as far as practical those of actual HTML
   browsers. In particular, never, never will it throw any sort of syntax
   error: the TagSoup motto is [7]"Just Keep On Truckin'". But there's
   much, much more. For example, if the first tag is LI, it will supply
   the application with enclosing HTML, BODY, and UL tags. Why UL?
   Because that's what browsers assume in this situation. For the same
   reason, overlapping tags are correctly restarted whenever possible:
   text like:
This is <B>bold, <I>bold italic, </b>italic, </i>normal text

   gets correctly rewritten as:
This is <b>bold, <i>bold italic, </i></b><i>italic, </i>normal text.

   By intention, TagSoup is small and fast. Eventually, I will spend some
   time making it faster if it turns out to be too slow. It does not
   depend on the existence of any framework other than SAX, and should be
   able to work with any framework that can accept SAX parsers. In
   particular, [8]XOM is known to work.

   You can replace the low-level HTML scanner with one based on Sean
   McGrath's [9]PYX format (very close to James Clark's ESIS format). You
   can also supply an AutoDetector that peeks at the incoming byte stream
   and guesses a character encoding for it. (Otherwise, the platform
   default is used. If someone supplies a good AutoDetector I may package
   it with later releases -- the [10]Mozilla one is too big.

  The TSaxon XSLT-for-HTML processor

   [11]I am also distributing [12]TSaxon, a repackaging of version 6.5.3
   of Michael Kay's Saxon XSLT implementation that includes TagSoup.
   TSaxon is a drop-in replacement for Saxon, and can be used to process
   either HTML or XML documents with XSLT stylesheets.

  TagSoup as a stand-alone program

   It is possible to run TagSoup as a program by saying java -jar
   tagsoup-1.0rc3 [option ...] [file ...]. Files mentioned on the command
   line will be parsed individually. If no files are specified, the
   standard input is read.

   The following optiones are understood:

   --files
          Output into individual files, with html extensions changed to
          xhtml. Otherwise, all output is sent to the standard output.

   --html
          Output is in clean HTML: the XML declaration is suppressed, as
          are end-tags for the known empty elements.

   --pyx
          Output is in PYX format.

   --pyxin
          Input is in PYXoid format (need not be well-formed).

   --nons
          Namespaces are suppressed. Normally, all elements are in the
          XHTML 1.x namespace, and all attributes are in no namespace.

   --nobogons
          Bogons (unknown elements) are suppressed. Normally, they are
          treated as empty.

   --any
          Bogons are given a content model of ANY rather than EMPTY.

   --lexical
          Pass through HTML comments. Has no effect when output is in PYX
          format.

   --reuse
          Reuse a single instance of TagSoup parser throughout. Normally,
          a new one is instantiated for each input file.

   --nocdata
          Change the content models of the script and style elements to
          treat them as ordinary #PCDATA (text-only) elements, as in
          XHTML, rather than with the special CDATA content model.

   --encoding=encoding
          Specify the input encoding. The default is the Java platform
          default.

  More information

   I gave a presentation (a nocturne, so it's not on the schedule) at
   [13]Extreme Markup Languages 2004 about TagSoup, updated from the one
   presented in 2002 at the New York City XML SIG and at XML 2002. This
   is the main high-level documentation about how TagSoup works. Formats:
   [14]OpenOffice.org [15]Powerpoint [16]PDF.

   I also had people add [17]"evil" HTML to a large poster so that I
   could [18]clean it up; View Source is probably more useful than
   ordinary browsing. The original instructions were:

                        SOUPE DE BALISES (BE EVIL)!
   Ecritez une balise ouvrante (sans attributs)
   ou fermante HTML ici, s.v.p.

   There is a [19]tagsoup-friends mailing list hosted at [20]Yahoo
   Groups. You can [21]join via the Web, or by sending a blank email to

   open to all.
