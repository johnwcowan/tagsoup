       jjaavvaa --jjaarr ttaaggssoouupp--11..00rrcc33 [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Rectify  arbitrary  HTML into clean XHTML, using a tailored description
       of HTML.  The output will be well-formed XML, but not necessarily _v_a_l_i_d
       XHTML.


       ----ffiilleess
              multiple input _f_i_l_e_s should be processed into corresponding out-
              put files

       ----eennccooddiinngg==_e_n_c_o_d_i_n_g
              specifies the encoding of input files

       ----hhttmmll output rectified HTML rather than XML

       ----lleexxiiccaall
              output lexical features (specifically comments)

       ----nnoonnss suppress namespaces in output

       ----nnoobbooggoonnss
              suppress unknown non-HTML elements in output

       ----aannyy  treat unknown non-HTML elements as allowing any content

       ----nnooccddaattaa
              Treat the CDATA-content elements _s_c_r_i_p_t and  _s_t_y_l_e  as  ordinary
              elements (mostly for testing)

       ----ppyyxx  output PYX format rather than XML (mostly for testing)

       ----ppyyxxiinn
              input is PYX-format HTML (mostly for testing)

       ----rreeuussee
              reuse the same Parser object internally (for testing only)

       TTaaggSSoouupp  is  a parser and reformatter for nasty, ugly HTML.  Its normal
       processing mode is to accept HTML files on the command  line,  or  from
       the  standard  input if none are given, and output them as clean XML to
       the standard output.  The encoding is assumed to be the  platform-local
       encoding on input, and is always UTF-8 on output.

       When  the ----ffiilleess option is given, each input file is processed into an
       output file of the corresponding name, with the  extension  changed  to
       _x_h_t_m_l.  If the extension is already _x_h_t_m_l, it is changed to _x_h_t_m_l__.

       TagSoup  will  repair,  by  whatever means necessary, violations of XML
       well-formedness.  In particular, it will  fix  up  malformed  attribute
       names and supply missing attribute-value quotation marks.  More signif-
       icantly, it supplies end-tags where HTML allows them to be omitted, and
       sometimes  where it doesn't.  It will even supply start-tags where nec-
       essary; for example, if a document begins with a <li> tag, TagSoup will
       automatically prefix it with <html><body><ul>.


BBUUGGSS
       TagSoup  can  be fooled by missing close quotes after attribute values,
       and by incorrect character encodings (it does not contain  an  encoding
       guesser).

       Processing TagSoup output through TagSoup a second time should in prin-
       ciple produce identical results, but sometimes does  not.   That's  why
       this release is not 1.0.

       TagSoup  doesn't understand namespace declarations, which are not prop-
       erly part of HTML.  Instead, any element or  attribute  name  beginning
       _f_o_o: will be put into the artificial namespace urn:x-prefix:_f_o_o.
