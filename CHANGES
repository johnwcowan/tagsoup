Changes from 0.9.7 to 0.10.1 (there is no 0.10.0):
============================
Convert to XSLT configuration exclusively;
	Perl code and tab-separated tables are gone
Remove xmlns:* attributes
Append "_" to attribute names ending in ":"
Don't prepend "_" to an attribute name starting in "_"
Handle namespace prefixes in attributes:
	"xml" prefix is handled correctly
	other prefixes are mapped to "urn:x-prefix:foo"
Ignore XML declarations
-Dnocdata=true turns off F_CDATA on script and style elements
Fixed off-by-one errors in character references that made them uninterpreted
Start-tags ending in a minimized attribute are no longer being dropped
XML empty tags are now supported (though slashes are still allowed in
	unquoted attribute values)

Changes from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7:
============================
Upgraded AFL to version 2.1
Passed through newlines in character content (very old bug)

Changes from 0.9.5 to 0.9.6:
=============================
Script element can appear directly in body
">" terminates a start-tag even inside a quoted attribute,
	to protect against unbalanced quotes
"_" is prepended to attributes that don't begin with a letter
Remove "xmlns" attributes from the input
All standard features can now be set
	(although there is no effect from doing so)
New "bogons-empty" feature can be set to false to give bogons
	 content model of ANY rather than EMPTY;
	-Dany switch sets this feature to false
TSSL now has an explicit group element to declare an element group
STML is a new XML format for modeling state-table changes
License updated to AFL 2.1

Changes from 0.9.4 to 0.9.5:
=============================
S in the statetable now means \r and \n and \t as well as space
	(as was always intended; brain fart!)
Ins and del elements are now allowed everywhere
TSSL now correctly supports attributes that are legal on all elements

Changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4:
=============================
Fixed paper-bag bug that revealed attribute type BOOLEAN to applications.
Obsolete ABSTRACT removed in favor of README.
Improved implementation of CDATA restart after bogus end-tag.
Allowed hyphen, underscore, and period in names as well as colon.
First cut at TagSoup Schema Language -- doesn't do anything yet.
Support CDATA sections on input.
Don't generate built-in entities within CDATA elements.

Changes from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3:
=============================
Convenience main program "tagsoup" in bin directory.
Begin to integrate tests.
Introduced BOOLEAN type (currently just converted to NMTOKEN).
Features that actually work are now named constants in Parser.
Double root elements are really gone now.
ID attributes weren't being removed from restarted elements.
Fixed a bug that made unknown elements disappear in some cases.
Parser is now safely reusable.
PYXWriter and XMLWriter now implement LexicalHandler.
Parser reports comments, startCDATA, and endCDATA events to a LexicalHandler.
ScanHandler methods now throw only SAXException, not also IOException.
-Dlexical=true switch sets the ContentHandler as a LexicalHandler as well
	(XMLWriter prints comments, ignores CDATA sections; PYXWriter ignores all).
-Dreuse=true switch reuses a single Parser object (no great speed gain).
We now disallow an a element as the child of another a element.
An empty input is now treated as zero-length character content.
HTMLWriter is gone in favor of an extended XMLWriter with get/setHTMLMode methods.
CDATA elements only terminaate with matching end-tags (thanks to Sebastien Bardoux).

Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2:
============================
No longer inserts bogus ; after unknown entity reference without ;.
Consecutive entity references now work correctly.
Setting namespaces and namespace-prefixes methods now works.
-Dnons=true option turns off namespace and prefix.
New feature http://www.ccil.org/~cowan/tagsoup/features/ignore-bogons"
	suppresses unknown start-tags (any end-tag will be automatically ignored).
-Dnobogons=true option turns ignore-bogons on.
Suppress unknown and/or empty initial start-tag always
	(prevents double root element).
Schema now allows style as an inline element, like script.
Schema now allows tr as a child of table to avoid problems with embedded tables.
Clear Parser instance variables to make Parsers properly reusable.

Changes from 0.9 to 0.9.1:
==========================
Incorporated patch for -jar support by Joseph Walton.
Incorporated patch for Megginson XMLWriter support by Joseph Walton.
Changed existing XMLWriter to HTMLWriter.
Rewrote Parsermain for better features, removed Tester class.
-Dnewline=true removed, now implied by -DHTML=true.
-Dfiles=true now used to generate separate outputs (old Tester behavior)
	with extension xhtml (removing any old extension).
Fixed nasty bug in HTMLScanner that was failing to fix unusual entities.
Don't attempt to smash whitespace to spaces any more.

Changes from 0.8 to 0.9:
========================
Ant-ified by Martin Rademacher.
Don't suppress colons in element names.
Entity problems fixed (I hope).
Can now set namespace and namespace-prefixes features (without effect).
Properly templatize HTMLModels.java.
Attributes are no longer in the HTML namespace.
Updated license to Academic Free License 2.0 + GPL 2.0.
